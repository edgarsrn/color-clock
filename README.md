color-clock
===========

Instead of hands, this clock uses colors to represent the current time.
It contains three concentric circles: the innermost circle represents the seconds, the next one - the minutes, and the outermost one - the hours. The background color represent the day of week.

Each part starts with red color, then gradually changes into yellow, green, blue, purple, and then starts over from red again.
